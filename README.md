# spotify-sample

This is a simple app

## Getting Started

When you open the app you will be sent to Spotify account, there you  have to accept some terms and when you accept the terms, you come back to the app and it lists your current playlist, there is one search place in this screen, where you can search for your artist and this research return the top 10 less played song from this artist.


It's a VIPER pattern inspiration, I used just viewcontroller, presenter, wireframe and model.

* There is just one button on the first screen when you didn't accept the Spotify terms because you should accept the terms to use the app.

* There are in the second screen one search bar and one table list, the first request returns a current playlist of the user.

* In the search bar you can search the artist and the request returns the top 10 less played sonf from the artist.
