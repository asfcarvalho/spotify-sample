# spotify-sample

This is a simple app for list the 10 less played song from a specific artist.

* It's a VIPER pattern inspiration, I used just viewcontroller, presenter, wireframe and model.

### Getting Started

When you open the app you will be sent to Spotify account, there you  have to accept some terms and when you accept the terms, you come back to the app and it lists your current playlist, there is one search place in this screen, where you can search for your artist and this research return the top 10 less played song from this artist.




* There is just one button on the first screen when you didn't accept the Spotify terms because you should accept the terms to use the app.

* There is in the second screen one search bar and one table list, the first request returns a current playlist of the user.

* In the search bar you can search the artist and the request returns the top 10 less played sonf from the artist.

* There is an image of the album,  the name of the song, the name of the album, the name of the artist, the duration time and one button play/pause.

### Running the tests

* Open the Spotify app, this is a requisite to play and pause the song and to see the currently played song.


### Built With

* URLRequest - the request framework
